                Gastronomic or food tourism experiences are much more than just eating and drinking at a destination. Food tourism comprises a continuum that extends from production (e.g.,
                agri-tourism and visits to artisanal food producers) through to post-consumption (e.g., value-added souvenir products and food waste management).
              </p>

              <p>
                Our educational research initiatives comprise an integrated, networked, and holistic approach to food and food culture that spans the continuum from production through
                post-consumption. This includes landscapes, place, agriculture and food production, food traditions, food presentations, hospitality, eating, culture and heritage, lifestyle,
                destination development, sustainability and importantly, their synergistic relationship between gastronomy as an expression of the culinary arts and creativity, innovation, and design.
                A wide range of initiatives aims to ensure that we all will have a quality destination offering a unique, diverse experience, and will be committed to responsible, sustainable,
                inclusive, and balanced development, to contribute significantly to the socioeconomic well-being of people.

          By definition, cuisine is a particular style of food preparation characteristic of a region. Its meaning and significance, however, is far deeper than this simplistic definition suggests.
          Cuisine is the outcome of a region’s unique history, its products/ingredients (and the land from which they come), and the social norms and customs of the group that dictate the way in which
          food is produced, prepared, and consumed. Cuisine is imbued with social and cultural capital. It is this social and cultural capital that is at the core of gastronomy and tourism.

        <b>These pillars are: (1) farming system, (2) the story of food, (3) creative industries, and (4) sustainable tourism.</b>

        <p>These four pillars are experienced as a “journey” co-created by the tourist and the host community in which they come together in a place-based approach that captures local character.</p>

        <p>Farming systems underpin the food system; they are the source of all cuisine.</p>

        <p class="pl-4 ml-8 border-l-4 border-gold">
          Cuisine is more than just food; it is an expression of culture and identity. By telling the story of local food (through sharing cuisine, cooking classes etc.), host communities share Thai
          knowledge and wisdom with their guests, creating a deeper and more meaningful experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an expression of culture, the stories of food and cuisine can also be expressed and experienced through creativity and creative industries (art, literature, and music, film, photography,
          fashion and many more.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Taken in their entirety, these create sustainable tourism experiences that contribute to community development, local pride, and an enhanced tourism experience for both tourists and locals.

                        Artisan chef and performing art students explore the selected territorial assets, including cultural, heritage and historical traditions (food, crafts, folklore, visual arts,
                        drama, literary references, and historical sites) and natural resources (landscapes flora, fauna, physical and social spheres of production). Together, they tested a
                        place-based approach that capitalises on distinct local characteristics that define a particular place. A creative research process demonstrated how to turn local assets into a
                        theater where senses of place was told through Thai performing arts, designing for an extraordinary pairing with local gastronomic delicacies designed by the chef.
